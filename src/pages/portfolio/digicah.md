Digicah was developed as a C# .NET application using WPF for the client and a command line interface for the server.
It has been released in alpha and can be downloaded from the dedicated Digicah website. _update: the website for this project is no longer available and the project largely abandoned for legal reasons but the desktop index page is available via archive [here]_
