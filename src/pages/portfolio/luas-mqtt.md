[Luas MQTT] is an open source node.js REST api that dynamically creates and publishes live LUAS (Irish tram/light rail system) RTPI time data to mqtt queues. The repo also includes the C++ code for an ESP8266 microcontroller to consume this RTPI timing data from an mqtt queue and display it on a 64X48 IIC I2C Compatible OLED screen. **View the repository here:** [Luas MQTT]
